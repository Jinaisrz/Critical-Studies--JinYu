# Week15: Gallery reflections-Bosode

The work I would like to discuss is Akinsola Lawanson's Bosode, a work in which the author draws on a number of science fiction novels and films to construct her own world-building terminology. Focusing on mathematics, philosophy, and medicine in the Nigerian ifá religion, the author uses fantasy literature and West African magical realism as inspiration to integrate the work into the ifá religion and to explore the relationship between determinism and choice through video design.

### According to you, how is this calculated?

In Bosode, the author uses binary calculations to create an ifá system that allows for divination and decision making systems. This kind of thing is one of the main beliefs that originated in Nigeria and the system is based on prophecy, divination and mythology to help others solve problems and make decisions.

### According to you, what themes are being explored in this work/artist?

From my point of view, the binary system in Bosode with ifá is combined with computer algorithms and represents a fusion of religion and modern technology. ifá is built to explore issues on a mathematical and philosophical level, and the two gods, one as a diviner and the other as a guardian of the crossroads, also illustrate the relationship between choice, chance and determinism in a sideways way.

### What other artworks are exploring similar themes, and how are they exploring this theme in different ways?

Morehshin Allahyari's 'She Who Sees the Unknown' has similarities. In Morehshin Allahyari's She Who Sees the Unknown, both authors use digital technology in conjunction with a religious exploration project, using 3D printing to design a group of sculptures influenced by Iranian mythology and history, and image generation techniques to recreate images of weird and cool children from the Middle East, using related traditional myths to explore themes related to colonialism, patriarchy and environmental issues related to the Middle East.

There are three differences between them. Firstly, Bosode's exhibition is a film design, while the other is a 3D printed sculpture. Secondly, Bosode explores the relationship between choice and determinism, while the other is a re-exploration and re-interpretation of an ancient Iranian goddess story.
