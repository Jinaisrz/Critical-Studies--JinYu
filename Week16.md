Based on Prototype, as performed by Viktoria Modesta, I would argue that Viktoria Modesta is more in line with the posthumanist artist. The emphasis on body modification and high-tech elements in her work is one of the characteristics of transhumanism, but more importantly the emphasis on individuality, self-expression and the exploration of diversity of identity in her work is one of the core ideas of posthumanism.

Whereas anti-humanism and philosophical posthumanism emphasise the critique and transcendence of traditional humanism, cultural posthumanism and the posthuman condition of existence emphasise the development and change to accommodate contemporary technological and scientific knowledge, transhumanism emphasises the possibility of a posthuman future through technological means to enhance the intellectual, physical and psychological qualities of human beings. Posthumanism is an intellectual and cultural movement concerned with human development, technological progress and bodily transformation, emphasising a critique and transcendence of traditional humanism and exploring the topics of human freedom, identity and pluralism. In Viktoria Modesta's work, her body modification and high-tech elements are in line with posthumanism, but with more emphasis on individuality, self-expression and the exploration of identity diversity, and as such I would argue that she is more in line with the characteristics of a posthumanist artist.

Viktoria Modesta's images and performances in her work are very individual and innovative. Her appearance and image have been technologically modified and designed in many ways, presenting a highly individual and innovative image and expression through her own body modifications and high-tech elements. For example, she wears prosthetic limbs and high heels in her videos, presenting the viewer with an image and aesthetic that is different from, or even anti-conventional. And the author's images and performances not only emphasise body modification and high-tech elements, but more importantly the importance of individual identity and diversity. Through different shapes and images, she presents different identities and roles, and this exploration of identity diversity is in line with the direction of exploration emphasized by posthumanism.

In the lyrics.
Another life filled with parts, circuit board connecting hearts
Nostalgia for the future
We're playing God, and now's the time
We're limitless, we're not confined
It's our future
...

Here 'circuit board' suggests the important role that technology plays in human life; 'Nostalgia for the future' implies the fantasy and aspiration for the future that post-human "Nostalgia for the future" implies a vision of the future, which is also advocated by post-humanists; "We're playing God"
"We're limitless, we're not confined" expresses the desire to transcend the limits of tradition, the freedom and diversity sought by posthumanists. All this points to the author's belonging to the posthumanist category.

In the interview for this work, Viktoria Modesta also emphasises the importance of freedom of creation and self-expression, stating that she is an anti-traditional, anti-rule artist who expresses her creativity and ideas through her music and performances. This is also in line with the view of self-expression and diversity of identity advocated by post-humanist artists.
