# Week14.1: What is literacy and what does it mean to call computer programming a literacy? 

Literacy is important to the status and financial health of nations and is generally interpreted as the ability to read and write for the use and understanding of numerous forms of communication. It is also used as a code of knowledge and literacy skills in various areas of society generally reflecting the literacy of people in society, for example: technological literacy, financial literacy, cultural literacy, visual literacy, etc.

In an age where technology is guiding social and cultural development and when computer programming is referred to as literacy, this means that it is seen as an essential skill necessary for full participation in the modern world. Programming is also a socially positioned symbolic system and communication phenomenon that expands on pre-existing forms of communication. This is precisely because computer programming has similarities to writing, as it has become a fundamental tool and method of organising information, with the most original underlying logic of building code being above or below writing. So while reading and writing were once the skills of a few, so too were programming languages, and this process needed to be "literate" in order to raise the digital literacy of society as a whole and to promote economic, technological and social development.

Reading, writing and modifying code is not only a skill that can be used in creative business, data analysis, data interaction, social activism and artistic creation. It can also be used as a cognitive skill, which involves mathematics, problem solving, logical thinking and creative thinking. In terms of social responsibility it allows one to better understand the ethics and values of the digital technological world, to adapt to the digital world and also to recognise that technological decisions have an impact on others, thus promoting ethics as well as social responsibility.

# Week14.2: What are the new thoughts that come to you and help problematising the notion of coding literacy?  Which quotes or sentences inspire you to think more? 

### To create awareness and interest in programming in society at large:

It is important to make the general public aware that programming is a fundamental skill and a tool that can be used in various fields such as computer development, finance, big data, art and design in the modern technological society. For the general public, learning to code can improve problem-solving skills, computer literacy and creativity. This social popularisation can be done by governments, educational institutions, science and technology museums, code artists, etc., working together to teach the public about programming in its very simple terms in the most intuitive form of music, visuals and interaction, as well as to raise interest.

There are other factors that bring up the interest of the public. One, reducing the public's resistance to the difficulty of programming. Programming companies can develop the most accessible programming software and programming languages for the general public, and all programming can be packaged into blocks of code that can be called up using very simple instructions. Secondly, the cost of programming hardware could be reduced. As Professor Sam Aaron says, a Raspberry Pi can be purchased for as little as 25 pounds instead of a computer, and in the future there will be more factories developing better and cheaper programming hardware.

### Programming learning games:

### Game one:

A survival game that can be written through code writing, a type of game that requires programming to complete, similar to a sandbox game. Players are free to practice, raise themselves, make materials, build facilities, earn money, fight against opponents and a range of other game interactions can be achieved by the player entering code. For example, to create a golden blade, firstly you need to gather the materials for the gold, secondly you need to heat and melt it, and finally you need to enter the mould and polish it to form the blade, and in this process the player needs to obtain the gold by writing the code for the corresponding golden cube, melt the gold by writing the heat in the temperature table, then move the melted material to the mould by coding, and finally set the cycle code for the movement of the material 200 times the material can be polished into a complete golden sharp blade.

### Game two:

The programming game is built by building virtual reality technology so that players can add to the gaming experience. From there the player can add programming tasks that allow the player to solve programming problems within the task, thus adding to the fun and increasing the player's motivation to learn. For example, people can be programmed to control the creature hunting in the game, people can be programmed to speak sounds that display the corresponding language strings, and people can be programmed to arrange the corresponding shapes.

Developing collaborative team programming software
The development of collaborative team programming software means that teams can work together better, improving efficiency and quality, and enhancing members' programming skills as it allows them to write, review, feedback, modify and test code together so that work can be more standardised, easier to maintain and more stable. Knowledge sharing and learning can be facilitated between members, leading to improved individual programming literacy and faster technological innovation.

### Education:

1. Schools can open up fun programming courses, encourage children to attend programming camps and increase the scale of youth programming competitions, thus increasing children's systematic training in programming.
2. encourage students to ask questions from a programming perspective, such as: what real-life problems could be improved through programming?
3. give children, teenagers or students an equal opportunity to provide programming solutions.

### Resources:

Provide more free lectures, programming online courses and open access to code resources for students, programming enthusiasts and the community at large.
