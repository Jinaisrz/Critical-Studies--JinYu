# Week12.1: How can computers deduce the laws of human survival in a gene-based society? 

### Question: What are the laws of human survival?

### Keywords/Search engine:

To begin, I first used Google in Chinese to search for the definition of "laws of human survival" and obtained 6,520,000 very broad results. Upon visiting the top search result webpage, I learned that the laws of human survival are mainly composed of natural and social attributes, and the strongest individuals can obtain the most resources.

### Keywords/Search engine/Library/Electronic database:

1. When searching for "gene-based society" in the first part of the entry, Richard Dawkins' "The Selfish Gene" was discovered. However, its overview did not explain how selfish genes construct living organisms. Upon reading further, the entry recommended E.O. Wilson's "THE SOCIETY OF GENES".

2. So I searched UAL's online library by typing in the author's name and the title of the book, and found that there was no book.

### Keywords/Search engine/APP/Library:

I searched for the book on the Chinese app "Dedao," which offers knowledge training, sharing, audiobooks, and book reviews. However, I found that the book was non-open source on this platform. I also searched for the book on both Baidu and Google search engines, but no useful results were found. Then, I added the keyword "pdf" to the search term and discovered the website "Huishu Net". I was able to locate and download an open-source version of the book from the website's collection of books in the humanities and social sciences.


### Keywords/ Table of Contents/ Research:

While examining the table of contents of "THE SOCIETY OF GENES" [1] I found the preface titled "The Social Rules of Genes" and Chapter 2, Section 1, "The Gene-Social." I believe these sections will be helpful to my research. The book explains that living organisms are equipped with selfish genes that have blind programming. These genes, like humans, have both competitive and cooperative relationships. In competitive conditions, genes are willing to do whatever it takes to secure a place in the next generation. The genome, with its six billion letters, contains all the information necessary to construct humans. Proliferation, regulation of interactions between genes, and mutations caused by changes in gene letter sequences provide the basis for evolution. Perhaps the higher intelligence of humans compared to other species is also a result of changes in gene management. The gene-based society has developed various ways to combat cheating in evolution, which is necessary for effective reproductive means and the maintenance of egalitarianism.

### Question: Under what circumstances is universal failure likely to occur, and what are the consequences?

### Keywords/ Search Engine: 

In the third search result on Google, an explanation of the basic characteristics of genetic mutations is provided by Abace Biotechnology [2]. Genetic mutations are characterized by randomness and non-directionality, and under conditions of natural or induced mutation, lower or higher organisms may experience universal genetic mutations. However, mutations are relatively rare under natural conditions, and most genetic mutations are harmful to the growth of organisms. This may result in the loss of the original functions of genes, and may also lead to harmful effects such as cancer.

### Question: How have the laws of human existence changed in the long term under a genetic society where equality fails?

### Keywords/ Search engines/ Google books/ Artist websites:

I searched Google for "The Law of Human Survival Under Basic Mutations", "genetic society in which equality fails", and in the search term I searched for "The Law of Human Survival Under Basic Mutations" and "A Genetic Society in which Equality Fails", and when I searched for the keyword "Human World with Genetic Mutations", the fifth entry was "What would the world be like if the human genetic mutation rate reached 10%? Under the post, a master of agricultural extension from Huazhong Agricultural University replied that many people would die. So I searched for "[Gene Mutation, the Law of Survival], [Human world with genetic mutation]" in google books, but I did not find any relevant results and the search volume of results is too large.

### Keywords/ Search engines/ Google books/ Artist websites:

Then I searched for "gene-mutated hierarchical society" on an artist platform and found Xiangbo Dong's anime "INCARNATION", which depicts the survival status of people in a world devastated by genetic mutations.  Firstly, family relationships are banned, and reproduction is optimized based on genetic matching.  Secondly, a formula is used to determine the value of life, and those who burden the world with their uselessness are abandoned.  Thirdly, gene levels are distinguished.

### Question: How should computers be simulated?

### Keywords/ Search engines/ Technology platforms / Technology practice video number:

I searched the search engine for "How can a computer simulate a genetic survival system?" and found that the system recommended removing the "?" symbols for a more focused search, so I found a blogger in the Chinese Software Developer Network who had read "THE SOCIETY OF GENES" wrote a "Biocomputational Simulation of Selfish Genes" where he used C++ to simulate a group of monkeys with independent behaviour and random lifespans using " Reactive Programming Principles" to simulate what will happen in the future, which involves creating monkey variables in a planner with priorities and timelines, setting when they will be executed through Actions, and then setting the life cycle in the planner. The authors encapsulate all simulation parameters in an Environment, thus capturing the concept of a random time period with expected values, standard deviations and normal distributions.

### Keywords/ Search engines/ Technology platforms / Technology practice video number:

Under the same search engine search there is a report from the China Science and Technology Network. The JCVI team built the genome and provided its nutrients so that it could be more easily modelled on a computer, thus allowing for better visualisation and extrapolation of gene changes within the cell.

So I searched for "Computer survival simulations" in technology video numbers and found a hands-on video in AI Technology Review in which the authors simulate natural selection by combining computer knowledge with computational biology to add a perception factor to each survival unit. In this law of survival, survival units are more about size and bulk when they have enough resources, and more about perception and speed when they don't have enough resources, etc.

My conceptual framework is to create a 3D visualization of human gene mutations, enhancements, and evolution, and link them to individual organisms. In the planner, perception factors and various survival variables (such as speed, strength, intelligence, etc.) are established based on priority and timeline, and lifecycles, gene levels, and the environment are set. Action is used to determine when to execute these factors. Ultimately, the computer simulation is observed to derive survival parameters in the gene society, and to summarize the laws and regulations of survival.
