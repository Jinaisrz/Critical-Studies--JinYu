1. What does "stupid" AI mean?
"Stupid" AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that are inferior to humans in their performance on specific tasks. These systems may lack certain aspects of intelligence, such as judgement, reasoning, learning, adaptive capabilities, etc. Compared to a highly intelligent system, a 'stupid' AI may only be able to perform simple, single tasks, or may only be able to operate with fixed guidance such as rules and templates.

2. What is the difference between a 'stupid' AI system and a highly intelligent system?
The main difference between a 'stupid' AI system and a highly intelligent system is the difference in their capabilities. A highly intelligent system is usually capable of handling more complex tasks such as deep learning, natural language processing, robot control and so on. A 'stupid' AI system, on the other hand, may only be able to perform simple, single tasks such as text classification, simple image recognition and so on. In addition, 'stupid' systems are often easier to develop and maintain than highly intelligent systems, as they are simpler to design.

3. What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of creating a 'stupid' AI system?
Potential benefits:
First, creating a 'dumb' AI system makes it easier to master its behaviour and performance, as these systems are less likely to have complex errors and unexpected behaviour. In addition, the cost and development time of these systems is usually lower, as they require fewer resources and skills.

Potential drawbacks:
Because they are limited in their capabilities, multiple 'stupid' systems may be required to complete complex tasks, which can increase the cost of development and maintenance. In addition, these systems may require more human intervention and supervision to ensure that they perform well and correctly.

4. How would such systems challenge our assumptions about intelligence and agency?
"Stupid" AI systems may challenge our assumptions about intelligence and agency. We usually assume that if a system can perform certain tasks, then it must have some form of intelligence. However, 'stupid' systems suggest that even in poorly performing situations, a system can be considered an agent or tool without having to have all the properties of intelligence.

5. How might such systems challenge our assumptions about intelligence and agency?
Developments in artificial intelligence have changed our understanding of intelligence and agency. Previously, intelligence was thought of as a highly complex and incomprehensible property that existed only in humans and certain higher animals. An agent, on the other hand, is an entity that can perceive its environment and perform actions to achieve its goals. The existence of 'stupid' artificial intelligence systems may challenge these assumptions. While these systems do not have advanced learning and adaptive capabilities, they are still able to perform certain tasks and produce useful results. This suggests that intelligence and agents may not be as highly complex and incomprehensible as we once thought, but can be implemented through simple rules and algorithms. It also suggests that an agent does not necessarily need to be highly intelligent, as long as it can achieve its goals in a given situation.

6. What ethical considerations need to be taken into account when developing a 'stupid' AI system?
There are many ethical considerations to take into account when developing an AI system. For 'stupid' systems, these might include
Ensuring correctness: Because these systems have a limited ability to learn and adapt, they may be prone to misunderstandings and errors. Developers therefore need to ensure the correctness of the system to avoid potential harm and loss.
Avoiding discrimination: These systems may make judgements based on specific rules and templates, which can lead to discrimination and inequality. Developers therefore need to ensure that the system follows the principles of fairness and equality.
Protecting privacy: These systems may involve the processing of sensitive personal data, so developers need to ensure that the system adheres strictly to privacy and data protection regulations and guidelines.
Increasing transparency: These systems may be easier to understand and interpret than highly intelligent systems, so developers need to provide sufficient transparency and interpretability to ensure that users can understand the behaviour and outcomes of the system.
