# Week13: Design Museum

### Impression:

The London Museum has a great "vibe". From the outside, it's designed with a strong sense of composition, set in a park, which is both unique and inviting to the community and passersby. From the inside, the domed architecture and wooden floor decor create a natural connection to the outside, and the spaciousness of the space creates a feeling of sinking into a theater (Figure 1). The compact exhibits are presented in a simple exhibition design, allowing me to focus more on the exhibits themselves. The themed exhibits, "Objects of Desire: Surrealism and Design", "WEIRD SENSATION FEELS GOOD: The World of ASMR", "Yinka Ilori: PARABLES FOR HAPPINESS", as well as the permanent collection of modern design, gave me an understanding of the function, experience, culture, history, feminism, art, and boundaries of design.
