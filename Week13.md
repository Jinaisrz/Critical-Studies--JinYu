# Week13: Design Museum

### Impression:

The London Museum has a great "vibe". From the outside, it's designed with a strong sense of composition, set in a park, which is both unique and inviting to the community and passersby. From the inside, the domed architecture and wooden floor decor create a natural connection to the outside, and the spaciousness of the space creates a feeling of sinking into a theater (Figure 1). The compact exhibits are presented in a simple exhibition design, allowing me to focus more on the exhibits themselves. The themed exhibits, "Objects of Desire: Surrealism and Design", "WEIRD SENSATION FEELS GOOD: The World of ASMR", "Yinka Ilori: PARABLES FOR HAPPINESS", as well as the permanent collection of modern design, gave me an understanding of the function, experience, culture, history, feminism, art, and boundaries of design.

This is not just an "ordinary" museum, it is more speculative than a "regular" museum. Its exhibitions showcase the past, present, and future of the world, as well as the playful, futuristic, and critical explorations of designers living in different periods and cultural backgrounds. For example, designs that express the poeticism of women's bodies, designs that break rationality, and designs for future overpopulation such as "foragers" are all on display here.

### Analyze the exhibition:

"Objects of Desire: Surrealism and Design" reflects the middle class using surrealism as a way to pursue inner desires in a radical, arduous, and dreamlike manner. This definition is derived from the exhibition's theme overview, object explanations, visual system, and visual interpretation of the works, presented in a chronological narrative structure from the beginning to the end of the exhibition. This standardizes the audience's understanding of the exhibition in a logical and linear structure in most cases. The curatorial discourse regulates the dissemination of knowledge and monopolizes the relevant knowledge of the present, just as surrealism in its early stages regarded "love and desire" as the pinnacle of forbidden reality [1] , yet Meret Oppenheim's sexually suggestive and joyful furry cup (Figure 2), which caused a sensation, was not exhibited. Le Corbusier designed a high-specification rooftop terrace for millionaire collector Don Carlos de Beistegui, and the apartment was also designed as a luxurious private space. Surrealism designed dreamlike houses for the rich, but why weren't they exhibited for other classes? Why does the spatial design create a lack of close connection between the exhibits? And what is the background of the surrealism movement?

Breaking the narrative structure of the exhibition and enhancing its historical and discursive knowledge can adapt to the real-time sharing of information in online exhibition communities. All visitors to the exhibition can scan the exhibition's QR code to join the exhibition community, where they can publicly discuss their thoughts on or add knowledge about "Surrealism". They can also read the complete history of the Surrealist movement and related exhibits, as well as recommended works and books. The connections between the space and the exhibits should be standardized and strengthened.


### Create my own exhibition:

1. I will design an exhibition called "Inclusive". While observing the modernist design exhibition section in a design museum, I noticed that there are plenty of excellent and rational industrial design products, such as Apple's electronic products, typewriters, and AK47 firearms, but there is a significant lack of caring design for disabled or marginalized populations.

2. The exhibition will mainly be presented in the form of clothing, food, shelter, and transportation, showcasing design achievements that have "completed" the goals of targeted groups, including clinical, post-war, disabled, sensory impaired, discriminatory, and age-friendly designs. Examples include a foot-operated mouse, guide shoes for visually impaired people, and VR job interview simulations for ex-convicts. Each exhibit will have a design background, design concept, and user video feedback.

3. The exhibition space will incorporate caring design theories, design concepts, visual systems, and exhibit categories. The selection of caring design exhibits can be done in collaboration with design universities, disability organizations, and other institutions through small-scale voting or recommendation processes, ultimately decided by the curatorial team.

4. The curatorial process depends on the curatorial team's understanding of the exhibition theme and the weight of their discourse. The clarity of the exhibition space and flow, completeness of the visual system, relevance and representativeness of exhibits, and clarity of the exhibition background and exhibit descriptions will all shape the curatorial knowledge structure. Participation of audiences, designers, artists, and curatorial institutions in the exhibition will also be crucial factors.

### Reflect (back) on my new exhibition:

1. Add something that allows visitors to experience the daily lives of people with disabilities or marginalized people, e.g. the visually impaired experience, simulated behavior of people with disabilities, or perspectives on the injustices experienced in life.

2. Adding experiential and caring design exhibits that allow visitors to experience design in depth.

3. Increase the number of discussion sessions between designers, artists and visitors [2].

4. Add more curatorial institutions.

Adding more experiences for the audience will allow for a better understanding of care design; adding author-viewer discussion sessions will increase knowledge of the history and presentation of the exhibition and break the curator's private narrative will; adding more curatorial institutions will break the authority of the curatorial institution. The aim of the above approaches is to redistribute power and tilt it towards the viewer, the artist, the designer, etc. Making curation more diverse in terms of participants will also enrich the intellectual structure of the exhibition.

### Critique the Design museum and the exhibition:

Looking back at the original exhibition I disagree with the decisions of the original curators and the selection of some of the exhibits also shows me that the surrealist work is very radical and extraordinary, but not all of it. Although the whole is narrated by a timeline, the curator's power to use space to allow confusing arrangements between exhibits can also confuse the viewer. The curators do not provide sufficient cultural and historical background knowledge, and it is as if the curators assume that the viewer is already familiar with Surrealism, which prevents the viewer from understanding the content in depth in the face of an overly simplistic articulation of the Surrealist movement and work.

The curators have left out the power of the audience, which should be strengthened; the audience belongs to a kind of marginalised group in the exhibition, and allowing the ideas of these groups to gain greater recognition in the exhibition could allow people to re-examine their own views. Lacking a more diverse knowledge structure, there are options for interpretation or real-time online exhibition communities to inspire viewers to think. The audience can be taught how to use surrealist thinking to create simple discursive works, increasing interaction as well as the level of knowledge acquired.
