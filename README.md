## Keywords/search engines

首先我先在Google上搜索“人类生存法则”的定义，得到12700000条非常宽泛的结果，访问网页最上方的检索链接，了解到人类生存法则主要是由自然属性和社会属性组成，强者能得到最多的资源。

First of all, I searched the definition of "human survival law" on Google, and got 12700,000 very broad results. I visited the search link at the top of the web page, and learned that human survival law is mainly composed of natural attributes and social attributes, and the strong can get the most resources.

## 关键字/搜索引擎/图书馆/电子数据库

## Keywords/search engines/libraries/electronic databases

1. 检索“基因社会”在词条第一部分发现了由理查德·道金斯出版的《自私的基因》，在其概述中并未解释清楚自私的基因是如何构建生命物体的。阅读到最后时候发现，该词条推荐了以太·亚奈马丁·莱凯尔的《基因社会》。
2. 于是我在UAL的线上图书馆通过输入作者姓名以及书名搜索，发现图书馆没有该书。
3. 我在中国的“得到”APP（该平台拥有知识训练、知识分享、听书以及书评等功能）上对其检索，发现该书是在该平台是非开源的；我在百度、Google搜索引擎中检索该书都未检所出有用的结果；然后我将搜索词条后面加上了“pdf”的词汇。检索出了“汇书网”，并在该网站的人文社科类书籍中找到并开源下载了该书。
4. 我在《基因社会》的目录中，找到了它的序言：基因的社会规则，以及在第二章：你的对手定义了你中的第一节：基因社会，我认为会对我的调研有帮助。其中提到生存机器装载了盲目编制程序的自私基因，这些基因像人一样具有着竞争与合作的关系。对基因来说，在竞争的条件下只要能在下一代中获得一席之地，连杀戮也在所不惜。基因组包含的60亿个字母，记录了构建人类所需的全部信息。增殖，调控基因之间的相互作用，以及基因字母序列发生改变而导致的突变，为演化提供了基础，人类较其他物种更高的智力水平或许也是基因管理改变的结果，基因社会为打击这些作弊演化出来种种方式，这样平等主义才能保证有效的繁殖手段。

1. Search for "Gene society" in the first part of the entry, find the Selfish Gene published by Richard Dawkins, whose overview does not explain how selfish genes build living objects. At the end of the reading, the entry recommended "The Genetic Society" by Ether Yanai Martin Lechel.
2. So I searched UAL's online library by typing in the author's name and the title of the book, and found that the library did not have the book.
3. I searched the "Get" APP in China (the platform has functions of knowledge training, knowledge sharing, listening to books and book review) and found that the book was not open source on the platform; I searched the book in Baidu and Google search engines but did not find useful results; Then I added the word "pdf" to the search term. We searched "Huishu.com" and found the book in the humanities and social science books on the website and downloaded it open source.
4. In the catalogue of Genetic Society, I found the preface: The Social Rules of Genes, and the first section of Chapter 2: Your Opponent Defines You: Genetic Society, which I think will be helpful for my research. It says that the survival machine is loaded with selfish genes that are blindly programmed, and these genes have a competitive and cooperative relationship like humans. For genes, under conditions of competition, even killing is necessary to secure a place in the next generation. The genome contains six billion letters that record all the information needed to build a human being. Multiplication, regulation of the interactions between genes, and mutations caused by changes in the sequence of the genetic alphabet provide the basis for evolution. The higher level of intelligence of humans compared to other species may also be the result of changes in gene management. The genetic society has evolved ways to combat these cheating, so that egalitarian means of reproduction can be guaranteed.

## 疑问：什么情况下会有可能形成普遍性失效，且有什么影响？

## Q: Under what circumstances are universal failures possible and what are their effects?

## 关键词/搜索引擎

## Keywords/search engines

在Google搜索引擎中搜索“普遍性基因突变”，在第三个词条中发现来自Abace Biotechnology公司对基因突变基本特征的讲解。基因突变具有随机性和不定向型，在自然突变和人工诱变突变的条件下低等或高等生物都有可能发生普遍性基因突变，而在自然状下突变较少，且大多基因突变对生物的生长是有害的，这可能会导致基因原有功能丧失、癌症等害处。

A Google search for "universal genetic mutation" turns up in the third entry an explanation of the basic characteristics of genetic mutation from Abace Biotechnology. Gene mutation is random and undirected. Under the condition of natural mutation and artificial mutation, universal gene mutation may occur in lower or higher organisms, while under the condition of natural mutation, there are few mutations, and most gene mutations are harmful to the growth of organisms, which may lead to the loss of original gene function, cancer and other harms.

## 疑问：人类的生存法则长期在平等性失效的基因社会下有什么变化？

## Q: How does the law of human survival change in the long-term under the genetic society where equality fails?

## 关键字/搜索引擎/Google books/艺术家网站

## Keywords/search engines /Google books/ artist sites

我在Google搜索引擎搜索“The Law of Human Survival Under Basic Mutations”、“平等性失效的基因社会”，在搜索关键词“基因突变的人类世界”时，第五个词条中的“如果人类基因突变率达到10%，世界会变成什么样？”帖子下，一位华中农业大学的农业推广硕士回答到很多人将会死亡。于是在google books中搜索“[Gene Mutation, the Law of Survival]，[Human world with genetic mutation]”，并未搜索到相关结果，并且结果的搜索量过大。然后我去艺术家平台上搜索“基因突变的等级世界”，检索到由Xiangbo Dong导演的《灵笼》，表现出了人们在基因突变的世界末日下发生的生存状态，其一，取缔家庭关系，根据基因匹配科学优化的进行繁育任务；其二，生命公式判定，给世界带来负担的无用者进行舍弃；其三，区分基因等级。

I searched The Google search engine for "The Law of Human Survival Under Basic Mutations" and "genetic society where equality fails." When I searched the keyword "human world with genetic mutations," the fifth entry was "If the mutation rate of human genes reaches 10%, What will the world look like?" Under the post, a master of agricultural extension from Huazhong Agricultural University replied that many people would die. So I searched "[Gene Mutation, the Law of Survival], [Human world with genetic mutation]" in google books, but no relevant results were found, and the search volume of the results was too large. Then I searched "the hierarchical world of gene mutation" on the artist platform, and retrieved the "Spirit Cage" directed by Xiangbo Dong, which showed the living state of people under the doomsday of gene mutation. Firstly, family relations were banned, and breeding tasks were scientifically optimized according to gene matching. Second, the formula of life dictates that the useless who bring burdens to the world should be abandoned; The third is to distinguish gene ranks.

## 疑问：计算机应该如何模拟呢？

## Q: How should a computer simulate?

## 关键字/搜索引擎/科技平台/科技实践视频号

## Keyword/search engine/science and technology platform/science and technology practice video number

我在搜索引擎中搜索“计算机如何模拟基因生存系统？”，发现系统推荐删除“?”符号可以检索的更加聚焦，于是我在Chinese Software Developer Network中发现了有一位阅读过《基因社会》的bloger写了一篇《自私基因的生物计算模拟》，他使用C++模拟了一群有独立行为，随机寿命的猴子，使用“反应式编程原理”模拟未来将发生的事，需要将猴子的变量以优先级和时间线的方式建立在planner中，通过Action设置在何时执行，然后在planner中设置生命周期。作者将所有模拟参数封装在一个Environment中，从而捕捉具有期望值、标准偏差和正态分布的随机时间段的概念。

I searched a search engine for "How do computers simulate genetic survival systems?" , found that the system recommended deleting "?" Symbols can be searched more focused, so I found a bloger in the Chinese Software Developer Network who had read "Gene Society" and wrote a paper called "Biological Computing Simulation of Selfish Genes". He used C++ to simulate a group of monkeys with independent behavior and random life span, Using "reactive programming principles" to simulate what will happen in the future, you need to set up the monkey's variables in the planner in terms of priorities and timelines, set when to execute through actions, and then set the life cycle in the planner. The authors encapsulate all simulation parameters in one Environment, thus capturing the concept of a random time period with expected value, standard deviation, and normal distribution.

在搜索引擎的同一次检索下有一篇中国科技网的报道。美国科学家们开发了3D、完全动态的最小活细胞动力学模型。JCVI团队构建基因组，并提供其养分，因此更容易在计算机上建模，由此可以更好的可视化推演基因在细胞内的变化。

Under the same search engine search there is a report on the China Science and Technology Network. Scientists in the US have developed a 3D, fully dynamic model of minimal living cell dynamics. The JCVI team built the genome and provided its nutrients so that it could be modelled more easily on a computer, allowing for better visualisation of how genes change within cells.

于是，我在科技视频号中检索“计算机生存模拟”，发现在“AI科技评论”的一个实践视频，作者通过计算机结合计算生物学知识模拟自然选择，将每一个生存单位添加感知因子。在这个生存法则中，生存单位在资源足够时更看重大小和体积，资源不够时更看重感知和速度等。

Therefore, I searched "Computer survival simulation" in the science and technology video number, and found that in a practice video of "AI Technology Review", the author simulated natural selection through computer combined with computational biology knowledge, and added perception factors to each survival unit. In this survival law, survival units value size and volume more when resources are sufficient, and perception and speed more when resources are insufficient.

我的思路框架就是将构建人体的基因突变、增值、演化的3D可视化，然后将基因联系到个体生物。在planner中以优先级和时间线建立感知因子和各种生存变量（速度、力量、智力等），以及设置生命周期、基因等级和Environment，并以Action设置何时执行。最终观察计算机推演的基因社会的生存参数是什么，从而总结生存的规律以及法则。

My thinking framework is to build 3D visualizations of the mutation, increment, and evolution of genes in the human body, and then link the genes to individual organisms. Set up perception factors and various survival variables (speed, strength, intelligence, etc.) in the planner with priorities and timelines, as well as set life cycle, gene level, and Environment, and set when to execute with Action. Finally, observe what the survival parameters of gene society deduced by computer are, so as to summarize the rules and laws of survival.





# Week13-Design museum

## Impression：

伦敦博物馆有非常好的“感”，从建筑外来看，它以极强的构成设计感建立在公园中，很特别却又与社区和路人加强了亲和感。从建筑内来看，具有构成感的穹顶架构以及木质地板的装潢，与从建筑外形成了自然的联系。空间营造出的开阔沉静，让这里有种下沉剧场的感觉。紧凑的展品处于简洁的展馆设计中，也让我更关注展品本身。主题展“Objects of Desire: Surrealism and Design”、“WEIRD SENSATION FEELS GOOD: The World of ASMR”、“Yinka Ilori: PARABLES FOR HAPPINESS”还有永久收藏的现代设计，让我了解设计的功能、体验、文化、历史、女权、艺术、边界。

这不是一个“普通”的博物馆，它比“普通”的博物馆更具思辨性，其展览的正是世界的过去、现在和未来，也展示出了生活在不同时代背景的设计师，对事物和社会事件的具有趣味性、未来性和批判性的探索。如：女性可以通过设计作品更诗意的表达自己的身体、突破理性的设计、为未来人口过剩设计的觅食者。

The Museum of London has a very good "sense". From the outside of the building, it is established in the park with a strong sense of composition design, which is very special but strengthens the affinity with the community and passers-by. From the inside, the structural dome structure and the wooden flooring form a natural connection with the outside. The space is open and quiet, giving it the feeling of a sinking theater. The compact exhibits in the concise pavilion design also made me pay more attention to the exhibits themselves. Theme exhibitions "Objects of Desire: Surrealism and Design", "WEIRD SENSATION FEELS GOOD: The World of ASMR", "Yinka Ilori: PARABLES FOR HAPPINESS "and the permanent collection of modern design, let me understand the function of design, experience, culture, history, women's rights, art, boundaries.

This is not an "ordinary" museum, it is more speculative than an "ordinary" museum, its exhibition is exactly the past, present and future of the world, but also shows designers living in different time backgrounds, interesting, future and critical exploration of things and social events. For example, women can express their bodies more poetical through design works, break through rational design, and design foragers for future overpopulation.

## Analyze the exhibition:

“Objects of Desire: Surrealism and Design”反映着中产阶级在使用超现实主义的方式，激进、艰苦、梦一般的在追求内在需求。这种定义是我来自展览的主题概述、展品解释、视觉系统、作品视觉理解出来的，从走进展览到结束是以时间线的叙述结构进行阐述的，这规范了观众在大部分的情况下以逻辑更顺畅的线性结构跟随展览理解下去。策展的话语权规范着知识的传播，也垄断着当下的相关知识，就像超现实主义早期把“爱欲”当作受禁忌的现实巅峰，但Meret Oppenheim创作且引起轰动的充满情色与欢乐的毛茸杯却并没能展出。勒·柯布西耶为千万富翁的收藏家Don Carlos de Beistegui设计高规格屋顶露台，公寓也被设计成豪华私人场所，那超现实主义为富人设计出了梦一般的房子，而展览为什么没展出它为其他阶级？为什么空间设计使得展品之间缺乏紧密联系？超现实主义运动它的背景又是什么呢？

打破展览的叙述结构和加强该展览的历史知识和陈述性知识，可以适应线上展览社区进行实时共享信息，所有正在观展的人可以扫展览二维码加入展览社区，人们可以在这里公共讨论有关“超现实主义”的感想或补充知识，也可以阅读超现实主义运动和相关展品的完整历史和推荐相关作品以及书籍。规范和加强空间与展品之间的联系。

"Objects of Desire: Surrealism and Design" reflects the middle class's use of surrealism, radical, hard and dreamlike pursuit of inner needs. This definition is derived from the theme overview, exhibit explanation, visual system and visual understanding of the works of the exhibition. From the entry to the exhibition to the end, it is elaborated in the narrative structure of the time line, which rules the audience to follow and understand the exhibition in a more logical and linear structure in most cases. The discourse power of curation regulates the dissemination of knowledge and monopolizes the current knowledge. For example, in the early surrealism, "eros" is regarded as the peak of the taboo reality. However, the hairy cup full of eroticism and joy created by Meret Oppenheim, which caused a sensation, was not exhibited. Le Corbusier designed high-spec roof terraces for multimillionaire collector Don Carlos de Beistegui, and apartments were designed as luxurious private places, so surrealism designed dreamlike houses for the rich, but why didn't the exhibition show it for other classes? Why does the space design make the exhibits lack a close connection? What is the background of the Surrealist movement?

By breaking the narrative structure of the exhibition and strengthening the historical and declarative knowledge of the exhibition, it can adapt to the online exhibition community to share information in real time. All the visitors can join the exhibition community by scanning the two-dimensional code of the exhibition, where people can publicly discuss their feelings about "surrealism" or add knowledge. You can also read a complete history of the Surrealist movement and related exhibits and recommended works and books. Standardize and strengthen the connection between space and exhibits.

## Create my own exhibition:

· 我将设计一个展览叫做“全”。因为我在观看在设计博物馆现代主义设计展览区中有着大量优秀的且理性的工业设计产品，如：苹果公司电子产品、打字机、AK47枪械，但有关残疾人或边缘人群的关怀设计却少之又少。

· 展览主要以衣、食、住、行的方式进行叙述，展品主要包括、临床、战后、残疾人、感官障碍者、歧视、适老化等已“补全”目标人群缺失或未来思辨型的设计。如：脚用鼠标、视障人士导盲鞋、狱后工作VR面试模拟等。每一件展品都会有设计背景、设计思路、使用者视频反馈。

· 空间上关怀设计理论、设计思路、视觉系统，以及展品要以类别的形式紧凑地展出。关怀设计类展品的选出可以与设计类高校、残障人士等机构合作，通过小范围的投票或推荐来选出，最终可以由策展方进行讨论决定。

策展中固有的动力机制取决于策展方对某个主题展的理解以及话语的分量。展览的空间以及动线是否清晰、视觉系统归纳的是否完整、展品是否有关主题或是否具有代表性、展览背景以及展品说明是否阐述的明白，观众、设计师、艺术家、策展机构是否都能参与展览之中，这些都会影响策展知识结构的塑造。

· I will design an exhibition called "Quan". Because I was looking at a large number of excellent and rational industrial design products in the Modernist design exhibition area of the Design Museum, such as Apple electronics, typewriters, AK47 guns, but there were very few caring designs about the disabled or marginalized people.

· The exhibition is mainly narrated in the ways of clothing, food, housing and walking. The exhibits mainly include the designs that have "completed" the missing or future-thinking of the target population, such as clinical, postwar, disabled, sensory disabled, discrimination and aging. Such as: foot mouse, guide shoes for the visually impaired, after prison work VR interview simulation. Each exhibit will have a design background, design ideas and video feedback from users.

· Spatially concerned design theories, design ideas, visual systems, and exhibits should be displayed in a compact form of categories. Caring design exhibits can be selected in cooperation with design universities, people with disabilities and other institutions, through a small range of voting or recommendation, and finally can be discussed and decided by the curator.

The inherent dynamic mechanism of curation depends on the curators' understanding of a certain theme and the weight of the discourse. Whether the exhibition space and the movement line are clear, whether the visual system is complete, whether the exhibits are related to the theme or representative, whether the exhibition background and the exposition of the exhibits are clear, whether the audience, designers, artists and curators can participate in the exhibition, all these will affect the shaping of the curatorial knowledge structure.

## Reflect (back) on my new exhibition:

1. 增加一些可以让观众体验关残疾人或边缘人群日常生活的东西，例如：视障人士体验，模拟残障人士行为，或生活中遭遇不公的视角。
2. 增加可体验式的关怀设计展品，让观众深入感受设计。
3. 增加设计师、艺术家与观众的讨论环节。
4. 增加更多的策展机构。

加入更多让观众的体验，可以更好的让观众了解关怀设计；加入作者与观众的讨论环节，增加展览的历史、陈述等知识和打破策展者私人的叙述意愿；加入更多的策展机构，打破策展机构的权威。上述方式的目的是让权力重新分配，权力也向观众、艺术家、设计师等倾斜。让策展的参与方更多元也会让展览的知识结构更丰富。

1. Add something that allows the audience to experience the daily life of the disabled or marginalized people, such as the experience of the visually impaired, the simulation of the behavior of the disabled, or the perspective of injustice in life.
2. Increase experiential caring design exhibits, so that the audience can feel the design deeply.
3. Increase discussions between designers, artists and audiences.
4. Add more curatorial institutions.

By adding more experiences for the audience, the audience can better understand the caring design; Join the discussion between the author and the audience, increase the knowledge of the exhibition history and statement, and break the curator's personal narrative will; Join more curatorial institutions and break the authority of curatorial institutions. The goal is to redistribute power in favor of the audience, artists, designers, etc. A more diverse group of curators will also enrich the knowledge structure of the exhibition.

## Critique the Design museum and the exhibition
回顾原来的展览我不同意原策展人的决定，部分展品的选择也让我看到超现实主义的作品是非常激进和非凡的，但不是全部。虽然整体是由时间线叙述的，策展人使用空间的权力让展品之间混乱的排列，这也会让观众困惑。策展方没有提供充足的文化、历史背景知识，策展方仿佛假设观众对超现实主义已经熟悉，这使观众面对阐述过于简单的超现实主义运动和作品，无法深度理解内容。

策展人遗漏了观众的权力，应该加强观众的权力动态，在展览中观众属于一种被边缘化的群体，让这些群体的思想在展览中获得更大的认可度，可以让人们重新审视自己的观点。缺乏更多元的知识结构，可以选择讲解或实时线上展览社区启发观众思考。可以让观众学习如何用超现实主义思维进行简单的思辨创作，增加互动以及对知识的掌握程度。

Looking back on the original exhibition, I disagree with the decision of the original curator. The selection of some exhibits also makes me see that the surrealist works are very radical and extraordinary, but not all of them. Although the whole is narrated by the timeline, the curators use the power of space to make a chaotic arrangement between the exhibits, which can also confuse the audience. The curators did not provide sufficient cultural and historical background knowledge. It seems that the curators assumed that the audience was already familiar with surrealism, which made the audience unable to deeply understand the surrealism movement and works with too simple exposition.

The curator has omitted the power of the audience, so the power dynamic of the audience should be strengthened. In the exhibition, the audience belongs to a marginalized group, so that the thoughts of these groups can gain greater recognition in the exhibition, so that people can re-examine their own views. Lack of more diversified knowledge structure, can choose to explain or real-time online exhibition community to inspire the audience to think. It allows the audience to learn how to make simple speculative creation with surrealistic thinking, and increases interaction and knowledge mastery.







# Week14.1

读写能力对国家的地位和财务健康很重要，它一般解释为读与写的能力，用于使用和理解众多的交流方式。它也作为一种知识密码，在社会中各种领域的读写能力技能普遍反映了社会中人们的素养，例如：技术素养、金融素养、文化素养、视觉素养等。

在以技术引导社会、文化发展的时代和当计算机编程被称为读写能力时，这意味着它被视为全面参与现代世界所必需的基本技能。编程也是一种社会定位的符号系统和交流现象，扩大了原有的交流形式。这正是因为计算机编程与写作有相似之处，因为它已经成为了组织信息的基本工具和方法，代码最原有的底层建立逻辑是在写作之上或之下的。所以，读写曾经是少数人的技能，编程语言也是如此，而这个过程需要通过“扫盲”，从而提升整个社会的数字化素养，促进经济、技术、社会的发展。

阅读、编写、修改代码的不仅可以作为技能作用于创意商业、数据分析、数据交互、社会活动、艺术创作等领域。还可以作为一种认知能力，它涉及数学、解决问题、逻辑思维和创造思维等。在社会责任方面可以让人更好的理解数字技术世界的伦理和价值观，适应数字化世界，也可以认识到技术决策会对他人产生影响，从而促进道德以及社会责任感。

Literacy is important to a nation's status and financial health, and it is generally interpreted as the ability to read and write to use and understand numerous modes of communication. It is also a kind of knowledge code, and the literacy skills in various fields in society generally reflect the literacy of people in society, such as technical literacy, financial literacy, cultural literacy, visual literacy, etc.

In an age of technology-driven social and cultural development and when computer programming is called literacy, it means that it is seen as an essential skill necessary for full participation in the modern world. Programming is also a socially positioned symbolic system and communication phenomenon that amplifies pre-existing forms of communication. This is precisely because computer programming has similarities with writing, because it has become a basic tool and method for organizing information, and the original underlying logic of code is above or below writing. Therefore, reading and writing used to be the skills of a few people, as did programming languages, and this process requires "literacy" to improve the digital literacy of the entire society and promote economic, technological, and social development.

Reading, writing, and modifying code can not only be used as skills in creative business, data analysis, data interaction, social activities, artistic creation and other fields. It can also be used as a cognitive ability, which involves mathematics, problem solving, logical thinking and creative thinking. In terms of social responsibility, people can better understand the ethics and values of the digital technology world, adapt to the digital world, and realize that technological decisions will affect others, thereby promoting morality and social responsibility.

# Week14.2
您有哪些新想法有助于解决编码素养的概念？哪些引语或句子激发您思考更多？
 
使社会大众对编程了解以及提起兴趣
要让大众知道编程在现代技术社会中是一种基础技能，也是一种工具，它可以运用在计算机开发、金融、大数据、艺术、设计等各种领域中。对于普通大众来说，学习编程可以提高解决问题的能力、计算机素养和创造力。这种社会普及可以由政府、教育机构、科技馆、代码艺术家等进行合作，以音乐、视觉、交互最直观的形式来向大众讲解术语非常简单的编程，以及提升兴趣。
 
使大众提起兴趣还有其他因素。一、降低大众对编程难度的抵触。编程公司可以为大众开发最易懂的编程软件和编程语言，所有的编程都可以被打包成代码块，只需要使用非常简单的指令就可以调用。二、降低在编程硬件的花费。如Sam Aaron教授所说，可以仅支付25磅就可以购买一个Raspberry Pi来代替购买电脑，未来可以有更多工厂开发更好并且更便宜的编程硬件。
 
编程学习类游戏：
游戏一：
通过代码编写可以编写出，一种需要编程才可以完的生存类游戏，类似沙盒游戏。玩家在游戏过程中的自由实践，自我养成，材料制造，设施建造，赚取钱币，打击对手等一系列游戏交互都可以由玩家输入代码来实现。例如，在打造一把金色的利刃，首先需要集齐金子的材料，其次加热融化，最后进入模具并打磨形成利刃，而玩家在这一过程中需要通过编写相应金色立方体的代码获得金子，通过编写温度表格中的加热来使金子融化，然后通过编码将融化好的材料移动到模具，最后对材料的移动设置循环编码200次可以将材料打磨成一个完整的金色利刃。
 
游戏二：
通过建立虚拟现实技术建立编程游戏，从而玩家可以增加游戏体验。从中玩家可以添加编程任务，让玩家解决任务中的编程问题，从而增加趣味性和提高玩家学习积极性。例如，人们可以通过代码控制游戏中的生物捕猎，人们通过编程说话声音可以显示相应的语言字符串，并且通过编程可以排列出相应的形状。
 
开发团队协作编程软件
团队协作编程软件的开发意味着可以使团队更好地协作，提高效率和质量，并且可以加强成员编程能力，因为该软件可以让成员们共同编写、互审、反馈、修改以及测试代码，从而使工作工程可以更规范化、更易于维护、更稳定。成员之间可以促进知识共享和学习，从而使个人编程素养提升和加快技术创新。
 
教育
1. 学校可以开放趣味性的编程课程，鼓励孩子参加编程夏令营，提升青少年编程大赛的规模，由此增加孩子对编程的系统性训练。
2. 鼓励学生以编程视角去问问题，例如：现实生活中有什么问题可以通过编程可以改进？
3. 给予孩子、青少年或者学生平等的机会去提供编程的解决方案。

资源
为学生、编程爱好者、社会大众提供更多的免费的讲座、编程线上课程和代码代码资源的开放。
 
What new ideas do you have that help address the concept of coding literacy? What quotes or sentences have inspired you to think more?
 
To create awareness and interest in programming in society at large
It is important for the general public to know that programming is a fundamental skill and a tool that can be used in various fields such as computer development, finance, big data, art, design, etc. in the modern technological society. For the general public, learning programming can improve problem-solving skills, computer literacy, and creativity. This social popularization can be done by the government, educational institutions, science and technology museums, code artists, etc. to collaborate and teach the general public about programming in very simple terms in the most intuitive form of music, visuals, and interaction, as well as to raise interest.
 
There are other factors that bring up the interest of the public. One, reducing the public's resistance to the difficulty of programming. Programming companies can develop the most understandable programming software and programming languages for the general public, and all programming can be packaged into blocks of code that can be invoked using very simple instructions. Second, reduce the amount of money spent on programming hardware. As Professor Sam Aaron said, you can pay only 25 pounds for a Raspberry Pi instead of buying a computer, and there will be more factories developing better and cheaper programming hardware in the future.
 
Programming learning games.
Game one.
Through code writing can be written, a kind of survival game that requires programming to be completed, similar to sandbox games. Players in the game process of free practice, self-improvement, material manufacturing, facility construction, earning money, combat opponents, and a series of game interactions can be achieved by the player input code. For example, in building a golden blade, firstly you need to gather the materials of gold, secondly heat and melt them, and finally enter the mold and polish them to form the blade, and players need to get the gold by writing the code of the corresponding golden cube in this process, make the gold melt by writing the heating in the temperature table, then move the melted materials to the mold by coding, and finally set the cycle code for the movement of the materials 200 times can polish the material into a complete golden sharp edge.
 
Game 2.
The programming game is built by building virtual reality technology so that players can add to the gaming experience. From there players can add programming tasks that allow players to solve programming problems in the task, thus adding fun and increasing player motivation to learn. For example, people can control the creature hunting in the game through code, people can program their speech sounds to display the corresponding language strings, and they can program the corresponding shapes to be arranged.
 
Development of collaborative team programming software
The development of collaborative team programming software means that teams can collaborate better, improve efficiency and quality, and strengthen members' programming skills because it allows them to write, review, feedback, modify, and test code together, so that work can be more standardized, easier to maintain, and more stable. Knowledge sharing and learning among members can be facilitated, resulting in improved individual programming literacy and accelerated technological innovation.
 
Education
1. Schools can open up fun programming courses, encourage children to participate in programming camps, and increase the scale of youth programming competitions, thus increasing children's systematic training in programming.
2. encourage students to ask questions from a programming perspective, such as: what real-life problems can be improved through programming?
3. Give children, teens or students equal opportunities to provide programming solutions.

Resources
Provide more free lectures, programming online courses, and open access to code resources for students, programming enthusiasts, and the community at large.
 
# Week 15
The work I would like to discuss is Akinsola Lawanson's Bosode, a work in which the author draws on a number of science fiction novels and films to construct her own world-building terminology. Focusing on mathematics, philosophy, and medicine in the Nigerian ifá religion, the author uses fantasy literature and West African magical realism as inspiration to integrate the work into the ifá religion and explore the relationship between determinism and choice through video design.

1. According to you, how is this calculated?
In Bosode, the authors used binary calculations to create an ifá system that allows for divination and decision making systems. This kind of thing is one of the main beliefs that originated in Nigeria, and this system is based on prophecy, divination and mythology to help others solve problems and make decisions.

2. According to you, what themes is this work/artist exploring?
In my opinion, the author's binary system in Bosode with ifá is combined with a computer algorithm that represents a fusion of religion and modern technology. ifá is built on a mathematical and philosophical level to explore issues, and the two gods, one as a diviner and the other as a guardian of the crossroads, also illustrate the relationship between choice, chance, and determinism in a sideways way.

3. What other artworks are exploring similar themes, and how do they explore this theme in different ways?
Morehshin Allahyari's "She Who Sees the Unknown" has similarities. In Morehshin Allahyari's "She Who Sees the Unknown," both authors use digital technology in conjunction with religious exploration projects, using 3D printing to design a group of sculptures influenced by Iranian mythology and history, and image generation techniques to recreate images of weird and cool children from the Middle East, using related traditional myths to explore themes related to colonialism, patriarchy and environmental issues related to the Middle East.
The differences between them are threefold. One, Bosode's exhibition is a film design, while the other is a 3D printed sculpture. Secondly, Bosode explores the relationship between choice and determinism, while the other is a re-exploration and re-interpretation of an ancient Iranian goddess story.

4. What is your favorite part/aspect/element of this artwork?
I really liked the setting of the different endings in Bosode, which provided me with more opportunities for engagement and reflection, and the philosophical exploration of digital technology combined with religion, which gave the project a more macro and exploratory nature.

5. Based on your comments, what parts (if any) could have been further developed?
I think the visual and sound design of the film needs to be optimized, for example, half of the author's body looks very unnatural flying from the right side to the left side of the screen, and the performance design and costumes of the author in the film also need further refinement. If possible, the film could be based on the audience showing how the binary works in the ifá system.

6. What the work inspired me
Bosode It is a very macro blend of art, technology, culture, philosophy, and religion, exploring the dichotomy between choice and determinism, and the contradiction between free will and fatalism, and it attempts to explore the nature of this dichotomy through artistic means. It also made me think about bringing computer thinking and computer elements into the research as well as the creation of the project, such as the author's use of binary as the basis for the construction of ifá. In the science fiction novel "Three Bodies", the author uses binary to build a humanoid computer of 30 million people to explore a higher civilization, which can provide me with more elements in creating digital artworks to build a worldview for the project.
